# Hands Up Script - FiveM
Extremely simple and easy to install hands up script.

Made only on the base that the first results when searching for one end up with scripts running constant threads for iscontrolpressed on clients as well as other un-necessary nonsense.

This is convenient, friendly for roleplay/usage and drag and drop.

Requires [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib/releases/latest)
